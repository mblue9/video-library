To characterize the underlying\nbacterial factors driving the epidemic, isolates have been sent for whole-genome sequencing.  Doctors and public\nhealth authorities request information in order to take decisions. In this course it will be demonstrated how\nyou would make use of NGS to answer several questions relevant for patient and public health system management\nsuch as:\n  - Are there cases of drug resistant bacteria?\n  - Is there transmission of drug resistance?\n  - Is there evidence of de novo emergence of resistance?\n  - Are there multiple infections per patient?\n  - Do we have on-going transmission?\n\nWe hope that at the end of the different training sessions you can answer this question on your own!\n"

In this part of the workshop you will learn how to\nanalyse those sequences.\n\nIn a typical bioinformatic pipeline you would store your sequences in a computer server\nwhere all necessary software would be installed. This would be a server running the\noperating system LINUX, which is the most efficient way to run bioinformatics pipelines\n(more on this on Part 5). You will be running your analysis in a LINUX server from Galaxy,\nbut instead of writing directly commands to execute operations in the server, you will be\nexecuting operations through a Galaxy graphical interface. This allows you to have access\nto a LINUX server and to run workflows without knowing LINUX. Importantly, for training\npurposes  it also allows you to dedicate more attention in trying to understand what is\nbeing done in each of the steps without having to understand the programing behind. This\nbeing said, working directly on a LINUX cluster provides you always more flexibility, but\nif you donâ€™t have access to one, Galaxy is a very good alternative for data analysis.\n\nYou will need to understand how to use Galaxy to run all the hands-on tutorials and\ntherefore is highly recommended that you follow the next webinar and hands-on on Galaxy.\nThe good thing about this is that once you know how it works, you can use it to run your\nown analysis with your own data.\n"

      "description": "Once you have received your sequences, the first step is to assess the quality of\nsequencing. Once we are sure that the sequencing worked well, we typically compare our\nsequencing results to a reference genome (re-sequencing approach) by using a\nbioinformatics procedure usually called mapping. After, we will identify the genomic\nvariants in our sequences with respect to the reference genome, a bioinformatics procedure\ncalled, variant calling. Once we are certain of the variants we have identified, usually\nwe are interested in determining to what genes they belong, to what pathways or for\ninstance if they are likely to disrupt protein function. This procedure is called\nannotation. Once we have gone through each of these steps we are ready to analyse drug\nresistant patterns, draw phylogenetic relationships or identify clusters of transmission M.\ntuberculosis.\n\nYou are now ready for performing bioinformatic analysis in Galaxy. Before we start we\nwould like you to watch a short video on how Illumina sequencing works. Following that\nvideo we have prepared a webinar on mapping and variant calling of Illumina applied to\nMTBC. After watching it you will be hopefully able to know; how a reference genome is\nchosen, why we typically ignore some regions of the MTBC genomes or what is the difference\nbetween a fixed and a variable SNP and why do we care about it (among other things).\n",

Use of the shell is fundamental to a\nwide range of advanced computing tasks, including high-performance computing. These\nwebinars will introduce you to this powerful tool.
